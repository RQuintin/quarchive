# Quartermarker - social bookmarks in your browser

Quartermarker (a working title) is a mechanism for syncing your browser
bookmarks with a third-party server (provided) for fun and profit.

## Building

To build the server you will need Python 3 and tox.  To build the browser
extension you will need npm.

Build both with:

```make```
